## Description

_This web application will gather input from the user (name, address, and pizza specifications) to order pizzas. The application can handle multiple pizza orders and calculates total cost._

_The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of OOP in js, including the use of constructors and the use of object.prototype.method to add methods to an object._
_Goal: Create a website for a pizza company where a user can order a pizza and see the final cost._

_Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.


Objects drive business logic (in JavaScript not jQuery)
Specs written for JavaScript functions
Constructors and prototypes used successfully
Web application works as expected_

## Known Bugs

_There are no known bugs at this time. The functionality of this site is not completely utilized (some business logic exists that is not utilized by the UI)._
